# Changelog

## 1.0.1

- Keep menu-array initialization and diagnostic reads within their allocation. The extra sentinel is already included in the requested size; writing index `newSize` corrupted the heap when UI-dependent modules such as Automarket loaded.
- Reject invalid array growth sizes before copying entries.
